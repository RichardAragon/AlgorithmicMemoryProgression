One possible equation for an LLM model to follow to progressively process the memories it creates based on their generalizability is as follows:

```
M_t = M_{t-1} + α * G(M_{t-1}) * C(M_{t-1}) * P(M_{t-1})
```

where:

* $M_t$ is the model's memory at time $t$
* $α$ is a learning rate
* $G(M_{t-1})$ is a genetic algorithm that generates new memories
* $C(M_{t-1})$ is a classification algorithm that classifies memories based on their generalizability
* $P(M_{t-1})$ is a prediction algorithm that predicts how useful a memory will be in the future

The genetic algorithm would be responsible for generating new memories that are more generalizable than the model's current memories. The classification algorithm would be responsible for classifying memories based on their generalizability. The prediction algorithm would be responsible for predicting how useful a memory will be in the future.

The model would start with a set of initial memories. The genetic algorithm would then generate new memories. The classification algorithm would then classify the new memories based on their generalizability. The prediction algorithm would then predict how useful each new memory will be in the future. The model would then update its memory by adding the new memories to its existing memories, weighted by their predicted usefulness.

This process would be repeated iteratively. At each iteration, the model would generate new memories, classify them, and predict their usefulness. The model would then update its memory by adding the new memories to its existing memories, weighted by their predicted usefulness. Over time, the model's memory would become more and more generalizable, and the model would become better and better at predicting the usefulness of memories.

The specific algorithms used for the genetic algorithm, classification algorithm, and prediction algorithm would depend on the specific implementation of the model. However, the general principles outlined above could be applied to any implementation.

This is just one possible equation and set of algorithms that could be used to implement a progressive memory processing model in an LLM. There are many other possible ways to implement this type of model, and the best approach will likely vary depending on the specific application.
