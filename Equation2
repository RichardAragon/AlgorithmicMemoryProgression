The following is a possible equation for an LLM model to follow to progressively process memories based on their generalizability:

```
G(M) = M + P(M) * (M - M_avg)
```

Where:

* G(M) is the generalizability of memory M
* M is the memory itself
* P(M) is the probability that memory M is useful in the future
* M_avg is the average generalizability of all memories

This equation calculates the generalizability of a memory by taking the average generalizability of all memories and subtracting the current memory's generalizability. This difference is then multiplied by the probability that the memory is useful in the future. The result is added to the current memory's generalizability to produce the new generalizability.

The following is a possible algorithm for the LLM model to follow to progressively process memories based on their generalizability:

```
1. Initialize all memories with a generalizability of 0.
2. For each memory:
    a. Calculate the memory's probability of being useful in the future.
    b. Calculate the memory's generalizability using the equation above.
    c. Update the memory's generalizability with the new generalizability.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the model converges.
```

This algorithm will iteratively update the generalizability of each memory until the model converges. The model is considered to have converged when the generalizability of each memory stops changing significantly.

The genetic algorithm, classification algorithm, and prediction algorithm that you mentioned could be used in conjunction with the above algorithm to improve its performance. The genetic algorithm could be used to generate different sets of parameters for the classification and prediction algorithms. The classification algorithm could be used to classify memories into different categories based on their generalizability. The prediction algorithm could be used to predict how useful a memory is likely to be in the future.

Here is a possible sequence in which the algorithms could be used:

1. The genetic algorithm is used to generate different sets of parameters for the classification and prediction algorithms.
2. The classification algorithm is used to classify memories into different categories based on their generalizability.
3. The prediction algorithm is used to predict how useful each memory is likely to be in the future.
4. The above algorithm is used to progressively process memories based on their generalizability, using the parameters generated by the genetic algorithm and the predictions generated by the prediction algorithm.

This sequence of algorithms could be used to create an LLM model that can learn and remember information in a more efficient and effective way.

It is important to note that this is just a possible approach. There are many other ways to implement the above algorithms, and there are many other algorithms that could be used to improve the performance of the model.
